    "- Some stations did not capture wind gust data, though they have wind direction and speed. Then some stations do not capture all 3 measurements\n",
    "- Not all stations came online at the same time. Some start at 2000. Some start later. Some went out of commission for a few months or years and then came back online. Huge gaps in the data because of this. \n",
