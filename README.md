We will be working with hourly weather data from 120+ weather stations in the southeast region of Brazil.  The data has been recorded from 2000 - 2016 and includes measurements of temperature, humidity, dew point, pressure, wind speed, solar radiation, and precipitation. First, we would gather descriptive statistics around each attribute of the data and get monthly and annual summaries. Then we would like to explore whether we can see effects of climate change (longer droughts, higher temperatures during certain times of year, coastal versus inland, differences in elevation, stronger solar radiation due to thinning ozone etc). Then, based on this historical data, possibly extrapolating this to predict montly/annual temperature, precipitation, etc if climate trends continue the way they are.
